### When returning the Walleye back to the water, *please leave the loop tag attached*. This will be useful in identifying the Walleye again if they are recaptured at a later date!

### You're more than welcome to email me, but phone calls are preferred and will be faster!

#### Thank you for your contribution to the Watts Bar Walleye Study!
