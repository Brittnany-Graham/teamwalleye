title: Acoustic Telemetry
---


## What is it?

Acoustic telemetry, simply, is the use of sound to track aquatic animals through water!

## Acoustic Transmitters
Acoustic transmitters are small tags we surgically implant into the belly cavity of the walleye. Every 60-120 seconds, there's a signal we call a "ping" that is transmitted out into the water column, and if it's passing by a receiver, will be logged and used later to track the path of the fish. These transmitters will last for a total of two years.

So cool, right??

## How We Achieve This



To achieve this, we use acoustic receivers for long term, continuous tracking of aquatic animals! Since the receivers are always on, they are constantly recording temperature and signals from acoustic transmitters that are implanted within the walleye.

Then we use a specialized hydrophone to pick up transmitter signals in real time!

## How will I know if I catch a walleye that is part of this study?

Wonderful question! All walleye that are tagged will have an orange loop tag between its first and second dorsal fin (see below)! This tag will have a phone number and loop tag number on it, so when you call it in, we can quickly identify the walleye!
