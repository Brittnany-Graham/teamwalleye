# Team Walleye

## This is to document the website created for the project

This is to assist anglers who are interested in the study and if they recapture any of my study fish!

Watts Bar Reservoir is a popular recreational area, with anglers from all over the state to fish the mainstem Tennessee River!

In 2011, Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency Region 3 switched to stocking Walleye (*sander vitreus*) because in the south, they tend to grow faster, live longer, and provide better year round angling opportunities! 

In partnership with UT and TWRA, my project is focusing on the broadscale movement patterns of Walleye in Watts Bar Reservoir!
